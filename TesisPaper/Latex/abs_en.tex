\noindent The team orienteering problem (TOP) involves finding a set of paths from the starting point to the ending point such that the total collected reward received from visiting a subset of locations is maximized and the length of each path is restricted by a pre-specified limit. In this thesis, a biased random key genetic algorithm (BRKGA) approach is proposed for the team orienteering problem. Also, In every population generation, the best N results are inhanced with a sequence of local search heuristics. Computational experiments are made on standard instances. Then, this results, were compared to the results obtained by Chao, Golden, and Wasil (CGW), Tang and Miller-
Hooks (TMH) and Archetti, Hertz, Speranza (AHS). Though my results where very good and competite in most intances, in some they were not as good as mentioned previous works yet close enough.
