\noindent The team orienteering problem (TOP) is the generalization to the case of multiple tours of the Orienteering Problem, know also as Selective Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP). TOP involves finding a set of paths from the starting point to the ending point such that the total collected reward received from visiting a subset of locations is maximized and the length of each path is restricted by a pre-specified limit. In this thesis, a biased random key genetic algorithm (BRKGA) approach is proposed for the team orienteering problem. Also, In every population generation, the best unenhanced solution is enhanced with a sequence of local search heuristics. Computational experiments are made on standard instances. Then, this results, were compared to the results obtained by Chao, Golden, and Wasil (CGW), Tang and Miller-Hooks (TMH) and Archetti, Hertz, Speranza (AHS). Though my results where very good and competitive in most intances, in some they were not as good as mentioned previous works.
