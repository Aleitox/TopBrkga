\noindent In the orienteering problem (OP), a set of vertices is given, each with a certain score. The objective is to determine a path, limited in length, that visits some clients in order that maximises the sum of the collected scores. Orienteering can be formulated in the following way. Given $n$ nodes in the Euclidean plane each with a score, where $score(vertex_i) \geq 0$ and $score(vertex_1) = score(vertex_n) = 0$, find a route of maximum score through these nodes beginning at $vertex_1$ and ending at $vertex_n$ of length no greater than $tMax$.

The team orienteering problem (TOP) is the generalization to the case of multiple tours of the Orienteering Problem, know also as Selective Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP). TOP involves finding a set of paths from the starting point to the ending point such that the total collected reward received from visiting a subset of locations is maximized and the length of each path is restricted by a pre-specified limit. TOP is known as an NP-complete problem. The solution to this problem requires not only determining a calling order on each tour, but also selecting which subset of nodes in the graph to service.

In this thesis, a biased random key genetic algorithm (BRKGA) approach is proposed for the team orienteering problem. Random-key genetic algorithms initialized their population with a set of random-key vectors and a decoder. The decoder converts a random-key vector in a valid solution of the problem. Biased random-key genetic algorithms are a variant of random-key genetic algorithms, where one of the parents used for mating is biased to be of higher fitness than the other parent.

Also, in every new generation, the best unenhanced solution is enhanced with a sequence of local search heuristics. Local search heuristics such as Insert, Swap, Replace and 2-opt are used in order to find better local solutions for a given solution.

Computational experiments are made on standard instances. Then, this results, were compared to the results obtained by Chao, Golden, and Wasil (CGW), Tang and Miller-Hooks (TMH) and Archetti, Hertz, Speranza (AHS). Though my results where very good and competitive in most intances, in some they were not as good as mentioned previous works.
